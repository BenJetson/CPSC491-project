# React Storybook Tutorial Notes

Storybook provides dummy data for visually testing parts of our UI.
In this case, a story refers to a single rendered state of a UI component.
Storybook also lets you quickly swap between each of these stories and automatically refreshes them as you change your code.
You can also adjust the previewed screen size and aspect ratio, to make sure your UI looks correct on a variety of devices.
