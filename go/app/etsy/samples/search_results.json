GLaDOS\u2019 main goal was to beat Black Mesa to the creation of Portal technology \u2014 but loses as a result of the Black Mesa Incident which allowed an alien force to teleport into the facility, with the long-term consequence being a war between Humans and the race known as the Combine.\n\n----- \u27a1\ufe0f T-Shirt Details -----\n\n\u2022 Unisex sizing, printed on premium Bella+Canvas 3001 T-Shirts\n\u2022 Incredibly soft and stretchy, run true to size\n\u2022 100% combed and ring-spun Airlume cotton (heather colors contain polyester)\n\u2022 Fabric weight: 4.2 oz (142 g/m2)\n\u2022 Crew neck, shoulder-to-shoulder taping, side-seamed\n\nThis t-shirt is everything you\u2019ve dreamed of and more.

      "description": "ABOUT THIS ITEM\n\nThis Aperture Laboratories logo shelf display/fridge magnet has so many uses!\n\n- Use the included stand to turn it into a beautiful shelf display. \n- Put it on your fridge or microwave or use it to hold notes on your fridge (it will hold up to 10 sheets of A4 paper!). \n- Put it on your car as the ultimate retro car accessory! (NB leaving this magnet on your car for long periods in hot weather may damage it) \n\nWherever you decide to display it, this magnet will show off your retro credentials for all to see!\n\nEach item is 3D-printed in high-quality, eco-friendly PLA plastic, then lovingly put together by hand. During assembly two high-strength N52 neodymium rare-earth magnets are attached securely inside (one at each end). \n\nNo need to worry about the magnets falling off, being lost or chipping or scratching your fridge! And because the magnets are on the inside, it&#39;s much safer than other fridge magnets!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Retro-inspired 3D-printed, multi-coloured 3D magnet\n- Includes free stand to turn it into a shelf display!\n- Printed in eco-friendly PLA plastic, derived from renewable resources.\n- Each item comes with two N52 neodymium rare-earth magnets embedded inside\n- Each item capable of holding up to 10xA4 sheets of paper!\n\nYou get:\n\n-  1 x Aperture Laboratories magnet (H 45mm, W 189mm, D 6mm)\n-  1 x Magnetic kickstand (turns it into a shelf display)\n\n* Due to the nature of 3D printing, each part may have small deviations from the one pictured above, yet each piece is carefully checked for quality and the absence of major defects! Also, expect to see some slight evidence of the printing process on each magnet. However, this should not detract from the overall retro effect!\n\nNOTES ON DELIVERY TIMES\n\nI will endeavour to post all items within 3 business days. Normally I will post much quicker.\n\nDelivery times are as follows:\n\n- To UK = 2-3 days.\n- To Europe = 3-5 business days.\n- To Rest of the World (incl. USA) = 5-7 business days.",
